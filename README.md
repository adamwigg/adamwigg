- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working towards a Masters of IT (AI/ML) at UC.
- ðŸŒ± Exploring with python, pytorch, fastapi and svelte.
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on any creative Python, AI/ML projects.
- ðŸ¤« Secretly love type hinting.

- Pandas - cute once I found chaining
- Numpy - crunchy.
- SciKit-learn - Not fancy but so useful.
- PyTorch - lightning and fast.ai kind of tip me this way.
- OpenCV/Pillow - to think I used photoshop for so many years.
- Mediapipe - ok this is a neat.
- FastAPI - See secret above.
- SQLAlchemy - plays well with others.
- Tkinter - can be clean and pretty.
